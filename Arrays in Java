An Array is a collection of elements of the same type stored in contiguous memory locations.
The 2 rules are 
1. Elements will be of the same type which will ensure they have the same size.
2. Contiguous means the whole array is stored at the same memory location.

Arrays are declared in Java in the following manners

1. int[] a;
   int a[];
   The general rule is datatype[] arrayname; or datatype arrayname[];
int[] a;
int a[];

both of these are null

Automatic initialization
int[] a={1,2,3};
int a[]={1,2,3};

Arrays with a given size.
int[] a=new int[5];
int a[] =new int[5];
this will create an array of size 5. The elements will be 0.
Java initializes all numerical arrays to 0.
boolean arrays to false
and all reference types to null

Another way of declaring arrays.
int[] a;
a=new int[]{1,2,3};

int a[];
a=new int[]{1,2,3};
